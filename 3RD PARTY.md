    * **Multi-license:** CC-BY-4.0
        * Attribution:
        <<beginOptional>> Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.
		Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
		Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
		Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
		Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees<<endOptional>>
		By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
		Section 1 – Definitions.
		   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
		   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
		   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
		   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
		   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
		   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
		   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
		   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
		   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
		   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
		   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
		Section 2 – Scope.
		   a. License grant.
		      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
		         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
		         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
		      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
		      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
		      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
		      5. Downstream recipients.
		         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
		         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
		      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
		   b. Other rights.
		      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
		      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
		      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
		Section 3 – License Conditions.
		Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
		   a. Attribution.
		      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
		         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
		            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
		            ii. a copyright notice;
		            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
		            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
		            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
		         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
		         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
		      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
		      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
		      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
		Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
		Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
		   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
		   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
		   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
		For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
		Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
		   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
		   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
		   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
		Section 6 – Term and Termination.
		   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
		   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
		      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
		      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
		   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
		   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
		   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
		Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
		   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
		   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
		Section 8 – Interpretation.
		   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
		   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
		   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
		   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
		Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

        <<beginOptional>> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		Version 3, 29 June 2007<<endOptional>>
		Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http ://fsf.org/>
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
		   0. Additional Definitions.
		      
		      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
		      
		      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
		      
		      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
		      
		      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".
		      
		      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
		      
		      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
		   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
		   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
		      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
		      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
		   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
		   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
		      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
		      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		   4. Combined Works.
		   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
		      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
		      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		      d) Do one of the following:
		         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
		         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
		      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
		   5. Combined Libraries.
		   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
		      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
		      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
		   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
		   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
		   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
		   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        <<beginOptional>> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		Version 3, 29 June 2007<<endOptional>>
		Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http ://fsf.org/>
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
		   0. Additional Definitions.
		      
		      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
		      
		      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
		      
		      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
		      
		      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".
		      
		      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
		      
		      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
		   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
		   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
		      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
		      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
		   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
		   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
		      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
		      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		   4. Combined Works.
		   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
		      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
		      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		      d) Do one of the following:
		         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
		         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
		      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
		   5. Combined Libraries.
		   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
		      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
		      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
		   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
		   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
		   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
		   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

		1\.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
		You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test you’re applications.  You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your applications.
		
		2\.    THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
		3\.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
		a.     DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.

		        others have the right to modify it.
		
		4\.    DATA.
		a.     Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
		b.    Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.
		5\.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
		        work around any technical limitations in the software;
		
		        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;
		
		        remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
		
		        use the software in any way that is against the law; or

		6\.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.  
		7\.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
		8\.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
		9\.    APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
		10\. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
		a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
		b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
		c)    Germany and Austria.
		(i)        Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

		Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
		11\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
		12\. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
		This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
		
		It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
		
		Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
		a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
		b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software.

        MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
		
		MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY
		
		These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.
		
		IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
		
		1\.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
		You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test you’re applications.  You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your applications.
		
		2\.    THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
		3\.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
		a.     DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
		i.      Right to Use and Distribute.
		        You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
		
		        Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
		
		ii.     Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
		        use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone distribution;
		
		        require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;
		
		        display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
		
		        indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the Distributable Code.

		        the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
		
		        others have the right to modify it.
		
		4\.    DATA.

Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
